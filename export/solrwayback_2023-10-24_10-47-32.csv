They were issued with Shamrocks by Lady Carleton-Smith, wife of Chief of General Staff. This year the parade was led by the Regimental Sergeant Major of the London Regiment, a Reservist Battalion who support the Regular Guards Regiments. The London Irish Guards today led by the Band of the Irish Guards to lay wreaths at the Guards Memorial to soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in two world wars and subsequent conflicts. St Patricks’ Day is the traditional celebration of the Irish Guards. On this day each year members of the regiment are presented with fresh shamrock. The Irish Guards is an Irish Regiment which has proven its loyalty and grit on many tough operations. Its soldiers have the privilege on guarding the Royal Family. They recruit from the island of Ireland, United Kingdom and beyond. They have been active from 1st April 1900 and specialise in the light role infantry. When they’re not deployed on operations the Irish Guards can be found all over the world training and exploring. They are also well known for their ceremonial duties here in London. The Irish Guards have deployed on operations over the last year in the Middle East and in Africa. Some of the Regiment are currently on Operation SHADER in Iraq, working alongside the Iraqi Security Forces in the ongoing mission against Daesh. The rest of the Irish Guards will be on Operation TRENTON, the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan.

He found that a magnetised needle moved when brought near a wire in which current was flowing, and that the effect was increased if the wire was formed into a coil. The idea of using this phenomenon as a signalling system soon occurred to several experimenters. This instrument is believed to have been used at lecture demonstrations in London.","","","","http://journal.sciencemuseum.ac.uk/ImageGen.ashx?image=/media/4173/fig-2-1983-0478_-0001.jpg&compression=90&height=125&width=125","/host_dir/MW-TNAUKGWA-41399-000-20200327175950-www.gov.uk-00027.warc.gz","413010622","sciencemuseum.ac.uk","","image/jpeg; version=1.01"

Called REACT, the programme was commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care, and is being carried out in partnership with Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Ipsos MORI.In 2020, the Barclay lab is responding to the pandemic by pivoting from influenza to study the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Our research on SARS-CoV-2 includes basic virology, serology, immunology and environmental sampling.

He found that a magnetised needle moved when brought near a wire in which current was flowing, and that the effect was increased if the wire was formed into a coil. The idea of using this phenomenon as a signalling system soon occurred to several experimenters. This instrument is believed to have been used at lecture demonstrations in London.","","","","https://journal.sciencemuseum.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/fig-2-1983-0478_-0001.jpg","/host_dir/MW-TNAUKGWA-64115-000-20230908221933-www.gov.uk-00037.warc.gz","411885982","sciencemuseum.ac.uk","","image/jpeg; version=2.2.1"

The first, at midday in Green Park, was performed with the aid of 89 horses from The KingÕs Troop Royal Horse Artillery to musical accompaniment by the Royal Artillery Band. Commanded by Captain Katie Lavin, The KingÕs Troop Royal Horse Artillery pulled six First World War era 13 Pounder Field Guns into the park. On the word of command each of the six guns fired blank artillery rounds at ten-second intervals until forty one shots had been fired.

Caricature: A young man in civilian dress, Battier, and two officers of Tenth Hussars, having their shaved heads inspected each by men of high fashion; pendant specimen skulls hang from hooks in background. Dedicated to the 'Commander in Chief' - central seated figure is identified by paper 'Cmdt Bat++', whose perfect head shape analysis 'won't do' [qualities too good]. BM 14657. This satirical print shows three seated men being assessed for their suitability for the Tenth Hussars (part of the British Army) using phrenology. Phrenologists believed that the shape and size of various areas of the brain (and therefore the overlying skull) determined personality. Hung from the ceiling among phrenological heads is a list of the qualities to be looked for. The head of the officer on the right indicates he has the quality of brutality, while the civilian with the normal shaped head is being rejected for being kind and civil.","","","","https://journal.sciencemuseum.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1983-0700_-0002.jpg","/host_dir/MW-TNAUKGWA-64115-000-20230908220615-www.gov.uk-00034.warc.gz","48989711","sciencemuseum.ac.uk","","image/jpeg; version=2.2.1"
